\section{Selected quality improvement and audit projects}

\cvitem{2022}{\textbf{Cefazolin procurement, Northern Care Alliance NHS Foundation Trust} I led the trust-wide application process to secure cefazolin for inclusion on the local formulary for the treatment of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia in dialysis patients or patients with penicillin allergy. This required an evidence-driven approach with extensive engagement with hospital management to build consensus and ensure clinical and operational alignment. The application was successfully approved in July 2022.}
\cvitem{2021}{\textbf{CO-GENT audit, NITCAR collaborative} Ongoing work with a team of infectious diseases trainees based in the North West (the `NITCAR collaborative', \url{http://nitcollaborative.org.uk/wp/}), in realising a national audit reviewing prescribing practices and adverse outcomes of gentamicin prescribing. I am assisting with the methodological design of the audit and leading the data analysis.}
\cvitem{2020}{\textbf{COVID-19 response, Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust} As part of the `Respiratory COVID-19 Outreach Team', while completing a year of general and respiratory medicine I collaborated closely with the respiratory, microbiology and audit departments of a large NHS trust to create, update and disseminate guidelines on the diagnosis, management and infection control of COVID-19. Additionally, in response to high levels of nosocomial COVID-19 transmission, I worked closely with colleagues in microbiology and Public Health England in leading root cause analyses and ward outreach work. }
\cvitem{2020}{\textbf{Community acquired pneumonia guidelines, Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust} I led the updating of trust-wide guidelines on the management of community-acquired pneumonia. The guidelines were ratified and implemented early 2021. }
\cvitem{2017}{\textbf{Guidelines on the management of CMV infection in inflammatory bowel disease, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust} I led a team of junior doctors in the auditing of the diagnosis and management of CMV colitis in patients with IBD. Wide ranging practice was identified. Results were presented locally. Following close engagement with virology, gastroenterology and trust management, consolidated guidelines were developed and approved in 2018. The audit cycle was completed and presented as a poster at ECCMID 2018.}
